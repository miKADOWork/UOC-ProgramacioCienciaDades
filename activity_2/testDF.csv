Silver metallic disc observed at Roseland little league baseball field.,Chicago,IL,1982-06-19 15:00:00,disk,45 seconds,"Silver metallic disc observed at Roseland little league baseball field. On a clear summer day on the southside of Chicago, I was at Roseland little league baseball field with a group of other juveniles. Someone in our group said to look up. I looked up and saw a silver metallic disc in the southwest sky of our location. This object was zigzagging at such a fast rate. It was such an abnormal flight pattern. My first thought was that it was possibly a kite. So I looked down to see if anyone had a string below. After not seeing anyone below, I looked up again and continued to see this object zigzag. The best way I can think of describing what I saw is to compare it to someone holding a mirror or metal object, and then reflecting the sun off of it. The event lasted about 45 seconds. The metallic disc then just took off up and out of sight. There were no lights on it no bulb no haze or any other crafts with it.  I went home and expected to see something on the news about it. No such luck. Being that I was a juvenile at the time, I didn't really give it too much thought. I figured there had to be a rational explanation to what we had all seen. Then I figured, it couldn't be from outer space because UFO'S were always depicted to hover, have lights and land. Not be visible in Chicago of all places. This recent report of the sighting at O'Hare has compelled me to tell my story.",41.8841229180932,-87.6674748940178

Another had one BIG red light and moved VERYY fast I was in my room watching TV, then all of a sudden, I couldn't even hear my show anymore because there was this loud, high pitched humming or whistling sound. So I run to my window and look outside... there's a huge square pattern of lights, with a flashing red one that would flash on one side, then a white one would flash in the middle. So I’m freaking out running outside and staring at it. When I look again, there's another light, moving SO fast, straight towards the square one. Just when i think they're going to hit, one moves down and the other moves up, then they continue to circle around the Fallbrook/Oceanside area. There was another one that was also circling that SOUNDEDD like a helicopter, but i knew it couldn't be because of its speed. And especially as it got further away, it was moving way faster than even a jet looks like it's moving, into the same general area that the other two went to. This happened three times. Unfortunately I couldn't find a camera in time to get a picture, but on the last round... SO FAR... i almost did but it was too far away. But when I did research on s square air craft... there was no government air craft that was square with lights like this one had. Then results came up as UFOs so I had to say SOMETHING.",33.3683441176471,-117.233477205882

"I saw what I at first thought was a Vandenburg launch to the west. Instead a vapor trail, orange in color, rose in the sky and leveled ",Fallbrook,CA,1999-11-11 16:50:00,sphere,10 minutes,"I saw what I at first thought was a Vandenburg launch to the west. Instead a vapor trail, orange in color, rose in the sky and leveled out heading east. The trail remained the same size, when it was overhead I saw that there was a round object at the head and noticeably separated from the trail. I photogaphed it with my digital work camera (I am a newspaper photographer). It was probably a jet or something like that, but so unusual looking. I can send an image if you would like to see it. My brother thinks its a jet.  . When I left work around 10 miutes to five today, November 11, 1999. I noticed a trail in the sky to the west, in the directon that we usually see the Vandenburg launches, and that was what I thought it was. It was still light out, but getting dark. The vapor trail seemed to rise but never got any longer. It headed toward me, to the east. The color was orange. I thought well maybe I should photograph this, so I  my camera out of the truck and took some pictures as it came toward me, as it became level with me I could see from the ground with just my eyes that here was a round object ahead of the vapor trail, and separated from by a distance about the same sizes the round object. The trail and object looked at arms length to be about 4-5 inches long. The picture clearly shows the gap. Does a jet plane have a gap behind it and the trail? If so I guess it could be a jet, the color  the trail, very distinct. Could it be caused by the sun angle, sun was below the horizon I think. Anyway, color was unusual and certainly round shape unusual. Would the roundness be another bit of work by the sun angle? I have a picture if you think it is worthy of further study I can send it.",33.3683441176471,-117.233477205882

I lost it for a moment and saw it again about 2 inch away and thought that moved pretty fast.It did this three times each one less bright.Then it seemed to stop and turn in a cicle , I thought that maybe I saw it do that because it was so small and so i was disorientated and thougyht I was going to loss it but it did stop and turned around, it justturned the way it came and speed off, much faster than it was moving when it was blinking,towards the moon, almost like the speed you would see a shooting star but i saw it much longer and it was a tad slower.

Light approaches at high rate of speed and makes a ninety degree turn.,Chatsworth,CA,1984-10-01 20:00:00,light,45 seconds,"Light approaches at high rate of speed and makes a ninety degree turn. I’m not at all sure of the date because I’m relaying this account some 20 years after the fact.   My husband and I were returning home one evening, the moon was full but it was only a blurred light behind a low(?), thin cloud cover.    We were walking to the front door when I saw a small, round, whitish light in the sky approaching from the west at a high rate of speed.  It was impossible to tell the relative size of the object or its altitude.   At first I thought there must have been a test from Lom Poc as they did launch many test missiles from this location throughout the time I lived in the west valley and they often caused some very strange displays in the sky.  But as this light approached our position leaving no contrails, it suddenly made a 90 degree turn, shot straight up through the clouds and rapidly ascended out of view.   The cloud cover parted in its wake in a perfect circle which continued to expand like a smoke ring.   I wasn’t quite sure if I had actually seen what I saw.  My mouth dropped open and I turned to my husband as we both spoke at the exact same instant:  Did you see that?   Neither of us could explain what we had just witnessed. I’ve told this story to a few people over the years when the subject of UFO’s would come up in casual conversation and to this day it gives me chills yet I can tell my listeners want to dismiss my story as just that a story.  The overactive imaginings of youth.  I have never claimed the object was extraterrestrial however I always do remind them that UFO only means the object was unidentified and flying.   I am still a practicing skeptic, but I just don’t have any rational explanation for what we saw that evening and as of yet no one else has either.

However it kept on traveling and soon was crossing over the highway. Then the object changed shape into a small dot. It looked just like a star, yet kept on moving. Then the object changed back to the boomerang shaped and kept on moving south, very slowly and smoothly, unlike any plane or helicopter I have ever seen. The the object/light, still in direct line of sight slowly faded out. It was NOT as if the object got smaller and smaller until you could not see if because it was getting farther.

The time was 5:40 a.m. I looked out my bedroom window, that looks out to the East, and saw a huge bright yellow light, that was hanging in the sky.  The light wasen't moving,so I grabbed my digital camera, that also takes videos. My bedroom, is on the second floor, so I could see this bright yellow light very well.  The distance was very hard to determine,I put it just in front of the mountains.  I don't have a tripod,so as you know, it's very hard to capture something in the night sky.  The craft started moving, and I said to myself come this way.  I was surprised, it did come my way, straight towards me,  that's when I started to video this bright light.  The digital camera I have, doesn't give me the greatest quality, but, as  you can see, there is something there in this video. As I videoed this craft flying towards me, I took the camera away from my eye, to see just how far away this craft was,I was shocked to see it was almost to my house.  This story sounds hard to believe, but, it's definitely is the truth. I'm sorry I had the screen on the bathroom window, because, when I took the pictures of this craft, flying over my head, the flash on the camera was set on automatic, so it went off, and it left me with a picture of the screen,and the reflection of the flash.  But, I did manage to get a good picture of it, from my bedroom window, which also shows smaller white objects attached to it.  The video is also empressing.  This craft was silent, except for a very low rumbling, or roaring sound., and the size had to be at least 100 feet in lenght,and at least 150 to 200 feet wide across the back.  It was pitch black,so it does make the size hard to determine.  If anything, it might have been larger.  When this FANTASTIC craft, flew over my house and yard, I saw that the tip of this craft, came to a sharp point, and, was not rounded. There were large circular lights on the bottom, that started from just behind the nose, then ran horizontally, across the bottom.  There were 3 or 4 rows of these circular lights. The colour of the lights were of a dim off white, with a tinge of yellow.  There was also, a tiny green light,thatI noticed just off to the right side of the craft,but it didn't look like it was attached to it. There appeared to be a black void between the craft, and this small green light.  The lights didn't reflect off the bottom,they looked like they might have been recessed,and I could see what appeared to be something, that looked like grill work, or something, that looked like that over the lights. This huge craft crossed the street, and headed West,and as slow as it was traveling, which I failed to mention,was about 25 to 30 miles per hr. IMAGINE THAT? What was also incredible, was how it banked to the left to go South, without slowing down, or speeding up.  It was as if it pivoted on the left tip, and came round,so that the front of the craft moved to the South. It continued to fly South, over the top of the high hill, across the street from me. I lost sight of it, as it past behind a tall tree that is in my yard, but I could still see the lights that showen through that tree, as it continued traveling South, until it was completley out of my sight.  If you are interested in seeing the picture, and the video, you may contact me.  SIGHTING:  Chatsworth, Ca  Thank You,  ((name deleted))",34.2547857594939,-118.588060917722

One night I looked up and saw one star slowly move into another. 3 days later I saw a 15 foot wide orange circle.,Chatsworth,CA,1978-01-09 03:30:00,circle,3 minutes,"One night I looked up and saw one star slowly move into another. 3 days later I saw a 15 foot wide orange circle. I was eight years old. I remember because my sister was an infant and she is eight years younger, born 11/01/77. I must admit that I saw Star Wars but there were aspects that I only came to understand many (14) years later. My Mother, Sister and I lived in one large room of a guest house on a ranch near Topanga Canyon Blvd. and Chatsworth Blvd. in the San Fernando Valley, California. For a few days prior to the sighting I would walk outside on the ranch. I would look into the sky and say to myself I know they're coming, I know they're coming... over and over again. After a few days of this I looked straight up into the stars and was only moderately surprised to see one very bright (like Venus) star slowly move toward another that was about 3-5 degrees of arc away from the first. When the first star reached the other star the moving one simply dissapeared into the other. Three nights later I awoke in bed and was drawn to look for where the bright orange light was comming from. I sat up in bed to see about a 15 foot wide circle or sphere of orange light moving slowly from left to right behind some big eucalyptus trees which were on the far side of a horse corral. The object was less than 100 feet away. I could see a, possibly, solid core with a glowing corona around the edge. I thought I should yell for my Mother who was only 20 feet away and in the same room as I. I did not yell instead I had a very strong urge to grab the 110 Kodak Instamatic camera on my window sill. My next thought was No, I don't want to scare 'them' away. As the light slowly moved down and to the right, behind some large bushes, I yelled Mother!!! U.F.O. She sat up in bed just in time to see the light but not the 'craft.' The next day, at school, I told my friends. They asked me to draw pictures. I drew pictures of the 'craft' changing shape, moving toward me and prepairing to land. I told my friends that I then yelled for my Mother and 'it' flew away. The reason I mention about my 'lying' about what I saw was that 14 years later I went to a hypnotist. I was not seeing the hypnotist for any reason at all related to the U.F.O. In the hypnosis session I began to see my childhood drawings in photographic form. I was not in deep hypnosis so I clearly remember the images, much to my surprise. Only later in life did I learn how children sometimes tend to draw their suppressed memories. I have done very little more significant investigation into my sighting. The date of the sighting IS APPROXIMATE but it 'feels' very accurate. The true reason I picked that date is the 1/9/78 4:30 AM Thousand Oaks sighting listed in this same list. Thousand Oaks is only about 15 miles from Chatsworth. I strongly feel that we may have both seen the same craft. I do know that the year is correct and that the day of month is approximate.",34.2547857594939,-118.588060917722

Plasmic bluish white orb of light east of  Mono Lake.,Lee Vining,CA,2005-11-23 21:00:00,light,2.5 hours,"Plasmic bluish white orb of light east of  Mono Lake The night was cold, moonless and clear. I was northeast of Lee Vining and while star gazing with a telescope I noticed a brillant light sitting on the ground appox 3 miles away near the east shore of Mono Lake. It rose straight off the ground and began making slow circles in the sky. Absolutely silent. At one point it passed over a mountain ridge to the east and lit up the entire ridge line so that every detail of the terrain could be seen. I later checked a topo map and this ridge was almost 12 miles away. It was so brillant that I noticed that when it came within 3 miles of me that my body casted a shadow on the ground. I also had a pair of binoculars but the orb of light was just a bluish white plasmic blob. At no time did I ever see the red and green running lights that would readily identify it as an aircraft.  At one point it was joined by a much smaller and dimmer orb of light. Through a pair of binoculars this orb also had no red or green running lights and made no sounds. They circled each other and made severl passes at each other. I eventually lost track of the smaller object and don't know what happened too it.  After about 2.5 hours the large bright orb of light landed on the ground about three miles from me. I put all my scope gear on the backseat of my car, turned off the lights, and headed slowly down a dirt road directly towards the object. When I got within two miles of it, the dirt road dipped into a dry wash that was about 1/4 of a mile wide, and when I came up the other side of the wash the object was gone. I turned of the engine and stepped into the darkness but the object was gone. The only sound were several upset packs of coyotes howling in the darkness. THEY WERE SPOOKED AND SO WAS I.  I have never reported this incident until now. I have seen a lot of strange lights in the sky after twenty years of star gazing but I could always explain them away. But this one has me baffled. At no time did I ever hear the tell tale noise of an aircraft engine. I am reporting it now because I noticed in your data of sightings that others at the same time camping near Bodie also saw the same thing but I was much closer. There had been several strong series of earthquakes in the area and I often wonder if what I observed were earthquake lights.",37.989,-119.1234

Observed with 10 X 50 binoculars by two friends who called me while I was watching the Fox UFO special that was airing at the same time.  I drove out to a vantage point overlooking the Mono Basin, but the vehicle had disappeared by the time I reached the vantage point, my friends stating that it gradually faded away rather than flying away as an aircraft might do.  It's interesting to note that this area has had numerous sightings in the past, the most recent being in Dec. 1998 when a lighted object was seen over Mono Lake flying west towards Yosemite National Park. Observers are long time friends of the reporter.  Their home is situated approximately 10 miles NE of the location of the sighting.  Weather was good, partly cloudy, no moon.  Venus and Jupiter, now situated in the western sky, had already set.  Observers have seen UFOs in the past.  The area where they live is remote, near the Ca-Nv. border.

Saw a blue-green glowing rectangular craft streak across our field of view while driving up the eastern side of the Sierra Nevadas.,Lee Vining,CA,2008-02-27 18:00:00,rectangle,One second,"Saw a blue-green glowing rectangular craft streak across our field of view while driving up the eastern side of the Sierra Nevadas. UFO Report:  February 27, 2008, 6:00 pm at Lee Vinnings, CA   This is the second UFO sighting I have had in my 61 years. The first was when I was 15 in New Jersey, and I will report that another time.   However, this more recent on was last year in 2008, occurring in Lee Vinning, CA, on Feb. 27th, around 6:00pm  as my wife and I were driving north on Hwy. 395.  I have to estimate the time because it was just starting to get a bit dark, and we were probably a bit north of Lee Vinning as well, but this is the general time and place.  I remember the date exactly because we were driving from Georgia to my son’s wedding on the 29th of Feb. in Fremont, CA. two days later.  Also, the reason I wanted to report it now is because I saw the exacted same thing a few nights ago on the History Channel’s program UFO Hunters.  They had a sighting around 3am around Needles, CA of a blue-green glowing rectangular craft streaking across the sky and coming down, which was later picked up by 4 military helicopters and taken away still glowing.  This occurred only three months later in May of 2008. As I was saying, my wife and I both saw this blue-green glowing rectangle streak across our field of view in front of us from West to East, or left to right, since we were heading north.  It took about 2 seconds, maybe only one actually to cross our field of view and it was gone.  I was amazed to have seen such a thing and do not believe it was a meteor because of the unusual color and rectangular shape.  Also, it appeared to be arching upward rather than down.  I guess we assumed it was a secret Air Force vehicle, being that Edwards and Area 51 were not that far from us.  But after the UFO Hunters story, I feel as though I would like to add my sighting to your files. As an artist, I did a quick drawing of our sighting in Photoshop and my wife just now confirmed that this is what she also saw that night last year.  I will attempt to attach the drawing to this report.",37.989,-119.1234

Blue-green luninescent objects moving at a high rate of speed, producing no sound and maneuvering at incredible angles to each other. ---------------------------------------------------- I thought it might be worth while to give my take on the report. As stated, I had just scored (the winning shot I might add) and threw my head back, and hands up in victory, when I exclaimed What the heck is that? I saw 4  fairly dim lights if you will, bluish-green in color, tracking east to west at a pretty good clip. The speed, east to west was constant. Their speed relative to each other, varied. My first thought was they were those spotlights used for attracting attention to businesses around the area, except there were no clouds to reflect the light, nor were there any beams emanating from the ground. Lastly, spotlights travel in a set pattern, extending out from a focal point, then returning, these definitely came in from the east, and disappeared on the western horizon. Now, all the while, these four lights were not just moving east to west, but performed maneuvers similar to those of the previously mentioned spotlights. At one point, they all came together, sort of spun around each other, then separated back into a new formation. While almost directly overhead, two of them stayed stationary in the center, while the other two, (one on each side of the two stationary lights) made circles as they flew. A little hard to explain, but if you hold up two fingers on each hand, put the index fingers touching side by side, and start rotating the second fingers in opposite circles (one move clockwise, the other counterclockwise) you can get an idea of the formation as it passed overhead. Of course, the tips of your fingers will represent the lights themselves. Now remember, these varying formations are still moving at a constant speed east to west. They traveled somewhere between 3/4, and 1/2 of a persons field of view, meaning east horizon, to west horizon in just about 10-15 seconds. The speed seemed fast, yet they almost seemed to be moving in slow motion. They made no sound whatsoever, which was noted immediately, since they did not appear to be that high in the sky. I cannot guess at an altitu! de, because I don't know the actual size of the objects. If they were the size of a car, then I would guess somewhere between between 1000 to 1200 feet. (ONLY a guess)  The two children who also witnessed this are my kids, and while they were enthralled by what they were seeing, once the objects moved out of view, became very scared and clingy for a lack of a better word. They were obviously shocked by what they had seen. Like my friend said, we live close to the airport (actually 2, LAX, and the smaller Torrance airport), so we know what planes are, and the normal tell-tale signs. (shape, lights, engine noise, flight behaviors, etc.) We had to play it off in order to calm the kids down. Later that evening, after getting them calmed, in bed, and convinced the aliens were not landing tonight, I went back over to my neighbors to discuss what we had witnessed. We both agree that we don't know what we saw, but we don't want to label it, especially without any other evidence besides our own accounts. A very surreal experience.",33.8590291666667,-118.3720625

We where hiking to a creek where we where going to sleep under the stars on the creek bed.  Soon after we got to the creek, we noticed that there were large rocks being thrown into the creek.  At first, we thought that the rocks where being thrown by some of the other boys.  That was not the case, since one of the boys got hit with a good size rock.  Then we noticed that the rocks where being thrown over 100 foot trees into the creek.  With that, we decided to line up in single file and sweep the wood line.  The wood line was around 60 feet or so thick, on the other side of wood line was a large open field there was no one there.  We where all shocked.   The scoutmasters decided to bed down on the creek bed cause it was too dangerous to go back in the dark, for thee boys got hurt during the sweep of the wood line.  We where instucted to dig into the creek bed, and cover our heads with our hiking back packs to shield us from the rocks, and we went to sleep.   At some point in the night I woke and saw two object with lights, blue, green and yellow, floating off center of each other up and down. the objects where cone shaped top and bottom with three lights in the middle, one on top and one light on the bottom of the objects.

It was right across the street facing Southeast, right next to one of the buildings in the Naval Medical Center. The object was only about 100 feet in the air and made absolutely no movement. At about the same time some other people attending the festival began to take notice of the thing. One woman said it looked like a floating trash can. I started making my way towards the object and ran to the opposite sidewalk about 60 yards from where I was standing. The object still was in the original spot still and now I could plainly see that the bottom of the cylinder rotated in a counter-clockwise motion, and the top portion rotated clockwise. It was definitely made of a metallic material, and had a sort of box like protrusion on one side. I just sat there with my jaw gaping open and so did about 20-25 people around me.

"Five objects moving together in close formation, hovering, and then moving off in seperate directions.",Laguna Hills,CA,2006-08-01 21:00:00,unknown,5 minutes,"Five objects moving together in close formation, hovering, and then moving off in seperate directions. The event occurred just over one year ago, at the beginning of August 2006. At approximately 9 o’clock PM, I watched a red light approach from the south-east. It was high in the sky, so at first I thought it was possibly a commercial aircraft. As it began moving overhead, it began to slow down noticeably. At this point, I called to my wife to watch with me. Once it was directly overhead, it stopped entirely. It was at this time that I noticed that the red light was surrounded by four white lights. If the red light was a square, the four white lights would be at the corners, one light at each corner. They were high enough that I could not tell whether they were physically touching or simply in close proximity.  The five lights hovered for about thirty seconds. Then, simultaneously, the four white lights shot off in separate directions, each one traveling toward one of the four cardinal compass points. They moved fast enough that after only a second I could no longer see them, but slow enough that I could track their progress until my view of them was blocked by surrounding trees and houses.  The red light remained stationary for another thirty seconds to a minute, and then vanished. When I say vanished, I don’t mean that it moved off, or that it faded away. It simply disappeared, as if someone flicked a light switch.  I’m sorry that I could not describe the shape of the objects. If the event had occurred during the day, I don’t think I would have seen them at all. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))",33.58965,-117.7008125

While this light was flying in this strange pattern, another bright yellow light appeared in the same spot that the original one had.  This started moving in the same pattern as the first one, but it did not travel as far neither vertically nor horizontally.  After a few seconds, it completly dissapeared.

Immediatly, it started move in the same direction as the other two, in a similar pattern, but this time more erratically.  It moved rapidly, and moved in the direction of other, stationary, flashing white lights.  It seemed to be flying in the direction of one light, then would change direction towards another light.  After about another minute, an airplane appeared over the horizon in the north west, and began to turn in order to alter it's course to follow the light.  After several minutes of the plane flying after the light, more airplanes began coming over the horizon from the north east in fairly regular intervals.  I saw about 10 or 12 planes fly in the direction of the light.

As I put my foot on the gas I notice an object over head, pretty high in the sky, about 50 degrees up from my horizon. This object was red on one side and green on the other, but from a far away distance it just looked like a red and green small blob moving across the sky in a sweeping flying motion. As I neared the middle of the distance of the long street, the flying object went out of view and basically just disappeared. I don’t know of many helicopters or planes that visible or low at midnight but ill just pass it off as a normal sight. I just ignored the sighting until all of a sudden at least 20 feet above my car there was a huge v like aircraft. This aircraft was about 10 ft long side to side and had a series of about 20 large square lights from side to side on the front of the V which was facing me.  The lights on one side were green and the other 10 or so extremely bright lights were red on the other side.  Once I saw this I swear my stomach dropped and I floored my car.  All I knew was that this wasn’t any toy plane at midnight or anything else I have ever seen.  This object flew over my car in the opposite direction I was going.  As I looked above over my steering wheel I could see the lights so distinctly like it was burned into the back of my eyes.

By the time I got outside I couldn't find the 1st object but I did see the 2nd object. It was moving from west to east, was reddish/white in color, and was a little larger than a star.  I ran back inside the house grabbing my Sony 8mm night vision camcorder.  I was able to record approximately 2:50 of footage of the object.  My camera did have difficulty focusing on the object so it does go in/out of focus however, I did manage some good footage of it.  The footage appears black/white/greenish due the night vision mode so the colors we observed will not be visible.  I converted the 8mm tape to a digital format so that it can be available for online viewing and uploading. Eventually, it disappeared into the night sky as it continued eastward. We did not hear any noise during the entire observation.  My family has observed similar objects near our residence the past few months.

Myself with two friends notice a pair of white-yellow lights moving in the sky. At first we assumed it was a jet aircraft, but did not notice any other white or red lights flashing as would on a normal aircraft. There was also no sound following the object, so we then assumed it was possibly a stealth jet. But we then realized that the object was moving entirely too slow to be any type of jet aircraft we are aware of. The lights seemed to be moving east/southeast until it took a turn more south. At that point of turning, more lights appeard above and around the original pair of lights. These flashing lights were primarliy red/orange. The lights were now far in the distance, but we were able to track its movement for at least 5 minutes from when we first noticed it until a house got in our way. It seemed as though it had originated from behind our location from watching its directional movement, meaning it could have flown directly overhead, or we would have had a much closer look had we noticed it sooner. We were standing in the neighborhood of Nellie Gail, where there are many large homes. This home was towards the top of a hill, so we were able to get a good sight from the street where we were standing. We moved out of the street light once we'd noticed the object and with that light out of our eyes, we were able to see how slow the object was really moving.",33.58965,-117.7008125
2 goups of 20+ haphazardly-moving spheres or obs circulating around each other,Laguna Hills,CA,2012-11-04 12:50:00,sphere,3 minutes,"2 goups of 20+ haphazardly-moving spheres or obs circulating around each other 2 groups of several spheres or orbs rotating around each other in a haphazard circular pattern.  These appeared to be a flock of birds at first, but a closer look revealed no apparent wings or wing-based flying motion and there also appeared to be a metallic quality visible as they turned into their circle.  The objects were circulating around in an unorganized 'follow-my-leader' kind of manner.   I ruled-out a bird formation when the circular motion appeared to be around a minimally-moving general axis tending towards a north-westerly direction.   There appeared to be 2 groups of these spheres/orbs - 1 group over the general area of Lake Forest and 1 closer west to the 5-Freeway.    As traffic progressed I was unable to keep constant eye contact and could not see the spheres in their general direction some 3 or 4 minutes later.",33.58965,-117.7008125

Pulsating orb appears over houses and draws police attention.,Laguna Hills,CA,2010-04-26 19:45:00,fireball,3 minutes,"Pulsating orb appears over houses and draws police attention. My son was outside when he ran in to tell me that he saw a UFO outside of our house.  Out of skepticism, I went out to see what he claimed to be a bright pulsating light going up and down towards the sky.  While waiting to see what he described this light appeared out of the tree line north of our location and began to go up and down, and at times side to side while at the same time getting brighter at times as if it was getting closer to our location and then backing away as it dimmed.  I captured this on my cell phone for about a minute and a half until it drop down towards the ground as a police helicopter approached and circled the same area for about 15 minutes afterward.  This was no helicopter or airplane in the sky that we all saw.  The way it zipped back and forth, no known aircraft can do that.  I was amazed that nothing was reported on the local news agency regarding this sighting because of the length of exposure and the obvious dispatch of the police helicopter to investigate this sighting.",33.58965,-117.7008125

2 or more UFO's on video at sunrise,Bloomington,CA,2011-12-16 06:00:00,unknown,4 minutes,"2 or more UFO's on video at sunrise The security camera in the driveway recorded what appear to be at least 2 or more unidentified flying objects.  It was an especially windy morning and the sun was just rising. About the camera: The camera self-adjusts to color from night to day.  The camera is a Sony PTZ but I couldn’t zoom in any farther as the camera is in a fixed location I can only zoom to the center of that view.  The camera is facing east.  I can only save whole minutes of video to the Lorex HD/system.  Sorry for the long wait before it actually starts. The UFO’s seem to be coming in straight towards the camera, which is facing east, and also recede in the same direction from whence it/they came.  From the video it seems that first there is one UFO and then another just pops into view at 06:01:52. There may be more than 2 objects.  It’s really difficult to tell as the wind keeps blowing the tree branches which partly obscure the view towards the end.  I don’t believe these objects to be planets. So, basically UFO appears from the east and then another UFO slowly comes into the view just to the left of the first one.  Then the first one is not really visible when a UFO suddenly pops into view again just to the left of the second one.  Then possibly the first and second one merges.  It's hard to tell if one is just behind the other or if it has merged with it instead or left altogether.  All then seem to come a bit closer before finally receding in the same direction that it/they came from. There is an airport, Ontario International (ONT), in nearby Ontario but the flight airways are more to the right/south coming in over Riverside.  Also, airplanes don't stay in one place as these objects did.  While helicopters can hover in place these objects do not fit the shape and made no sound.  At any rate I didn't notice any red or green lights that aircraft are required to have. I'm above average intelligence and not prone to making things up.  The video is 128mb avi file format.",34.0662,-117.3993

Present were: Myself, 28, stay home mom of two, Softball/Baseball coach, umpire, and player My Husband – 30, Installation Technician/Manager 7+ yrs My children – ages 3 and 6, 6 yr old in Kindergarten and one of the top students in class, perfect                  attendance My brother – 19, college student Cousin – 25, Warehouse worker, college student Cousin’s girlfriend – 22, 9 months pregnant with first child Girlfriend’s brother and cousin – 23 & 25, males, background unknown My Aunt – early 50’s, preschool teacher 10+ yrs, Devout Christian  My cousin and I were outside at approximately midnight PST on the evening of 5/15/2010 turning into 5/16/2010. We observed about 12-13 much larger than stars size circles that looked like glowing, orange, pulsating globes. As we watched them float slowly towards each other into a pattern, he went inside to get the others present. Within seconds there was about 10 of us, ranging from my youngest of 3 years, and oldest of 6 years, to my brother, 19, my cousin and his friends and girlfriend, ranging from 19-25, then myself, 28, my husband, 30, and my aunt, early 50's. 	As we all stood in my aunt’s front yard we observed a few of the lights just disappear. The remaining lights began to move into a formation of a straight line, each equally spaced apart. They were moving from right to left across the sky at this point. This happened in Bloomington, CA as we were looking I would say South/South East and watched the lights move I’d say North East. 	There was no noise. There were no other crafts in the sky in that area at that time or for any time after. After the lights assembled in their line and proceeded in formation, all but one of the lights disappeared. Just poof, gone. No fading, twinkling, or anything similar. Just gone. One final light remained that slowly started moving South/South East away from us. But it wasn’t just away from us. It was up. And I mean way up. It almost started going literally straight up into the air into space it seemed from where it had been. It lost its “Glow” but still had a very distinct light to it, and was easy to follow as it disappeared into the heavens. 	My son spoke of how scary the experience was, but he truly doesn’t understand, as neither do we, what truly happened. We've also submitted photos we were able to get plus a picture my 6 year old drew to the website.",34.0662,-117.3993

At first I assumed that it was a plane since I only seen it at a glance and since Ontario Airport is so nearby.  Figured I seen the plane as it was turning and only seen the green and not the red lights to signify port and starboard.  After a brief 1-1.5 seconds the light moved westbound in a quick motion leaving behind a bright green streak of light.  This speed was too fast to be a plane, jet or helicopter.  First assumption than was a shooting star however the fact that it was stationary when first seen and green leads my wife and I to assume it was something else.  Please post any comments if there were other witnesses.

Larger craft dropping off smaller crafts that lingered for over 5 hours.,Bloomington,CA,2010-03-26 00:00:00,light,5 hours,"Larger craft dropping off smaller crafts that lingered for over 5 hours. I first saw a strange light in the sky that very much looked like an approaching helicopter.  It caught my attention because it was orange, where usual helicopters have a white glow.  I stared at it for a few seconds and then it started dropping smaller white lights, and my first reaction was that it was dropping bombs.  I didnt think it was a UFO at this point, I thought it was an army helicopter or other army aircraft.  I left my room to go get my moms camera and returned with her and the camera only to find that the mysterious orange light was gone.  I looked throughout all the windows in the house, it was nowhere in sight.  I thought about it and brushed it off as a helicopter dropping flares because it was the only logical explanation I could come up with.  This was at approximately midnight on March 27, 2010. About an hour later, I woke up and my window was still open.  It was then I saw that the smaller crafts that were dropped were all clustered and flying around in unusual patterns in the North West sky out of my window.  I looked at them for four hours and couldn't figure it out.  I'm positive that they were what came out of the orange glowing craft.  They would fly diagonally, horizontally, vertically, and make turns that couldn't possibly be made by any aircraft here on Earth.  I seen them appear from point A to point B.  There was no trace of light as they flew because it was so fast.  They, like the orange UFO, were silent.  I watched them from 1:00 AM to about 5:00 AM then I thought I had enough and shut the blinds and tried to sleep.  I didn't see when, or if, they left, but I did hear a loud and unusually low jet fly by a little before sunset that woke me up.  I checked, and didn't see them anymore after that. The orange UFO was high in the open sky, and the white smaller ones were unusually lower than the mountain range that is outside my window.  Both the crafts looked like simple circular lights.  It was an extremely windy night so the sky was clear. I don't see how I could be the only one to see this, I'm sure others seen it as well.  It lasted for hours.  My moms camera and my phone couldn't focus on the objects, so no pictures came out that would show anything.",34.0662,-117.3993

I thought it might be landing lights of an aircraft, but it just hovered in the air. The shape was disk or saucer shaped, and it appeared in the horizontal orientation- like a flat oval. The light became very bright- like arc welding or a flash of lightning when all of a sudden, the object shot off at the speed of light at I would say about a 45 degree angle. It was much faster than any aircraft known to man. Although it did rise straight up slightly, it definitely was not a Harrier. I also experienced a loss of time and location. I do not know if the actual date is correct or even the city in which it occurred. I think others may have pulled over on the freeway to see it. I have always accepted the idea of other intelligent life forms in our galaxy or elsewhere in outerspace. The incident only strengthened my belief in UFO's and extraterrestrials.

As the objects flipped in abrupt directional changes, the top of the disk appeared to be a dark metallic.  The lights surrounding the craft would ocassionally flash brightly.  It appeared as if the objects were ringed with 8 white lights, and 1 larger red one which by watching the movements of the objects, would indicate being the 'front'. The objects were visible this entire time just barely under the low slung clouds.  They would dart in and out of the cloud cover, and then stay for extended periods below the clouds.
